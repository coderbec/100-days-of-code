# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 13, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Got through a starter tutorial on using Nodebots, which is a framework for programming microcontrollers (like Arduino) in Javascript. 

**Thoughts** I started this a few days ago and ended up running into issues transferring the code to the arduino, due to the fact I'm working on a macbook with only USB-C ports. I ordered a special cable and tried reformatting an old Mac Mini before I eventually found another cable we had in the house. 

I was really satisfied with getting over this first hurdle and actually getting a couple of working circuits going. I've been meaning to learn hardware hacking for years and had a whole bunch of stuff lying around that I'd bought ambitiously, but was starting from a base of zero knowledge about electronics or microcontrollers. Having completed this task was a great primer for being able to learn momre about electronics and hardware. 

Johnny-five, which is the library that makes it possible to do this in node, has a great ecosystem of documentation and example circuitry for each different kind of electrical component, which will also be useful for furture learning.
